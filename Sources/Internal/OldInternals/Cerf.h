	* @author Manuel Schiller < manuel . schiller@nikhef .nl >

	*
	* Calculate the value of the Faddeeva function @f$w (z) = \ exp (-z ^2)
	* \ mathrm { erfc }( -i z) @f$ .
	*
	* The method described in
	*
	* S.M. Abrarov , B.M. Quine : " Efficient algorithmic implementation of
	* Voigt / complex error function based on exponential series approximation "
	* published in Applied Mathematics and Computation 218 (2011) 1894 -1902
	* doi :10.1016/ j. amc .2011.06.072
	*
	* is used . At the heart of the method ( equation (14) of the paper ) is the
	* following Fourier series based approximation :
	*
	* @f[ w(z) \ approx \ frac {i }{2\ sqrt {\ pi }}\ left (
	* \ sum ^N_ {n =0} a_n \ tau_m \ left (
	* \ frac {1 -e^{ i(n\pi +\ tau_m z) }}{ n\pi + \ tau_m z} -
	* \ frac {1 -e^{ i(-n\pi +\ tau_m z) }}{ n\ pi - \ tau_m z}
	* \ right ) - a_0 \ frac {1 -e^{ i \ tau_m z }}{ z}
	* \ right ) @f]
	*
	* The coefficients @f$a_b@f$ are given by:
	*
	* @f[ a_n =\ frac {2\ sqrt {\ pi }}{\ tau_m }
	* \ exp \ left ( -\ frac {n ^2\ pi ^2}{\ tau_m ^2}\ right ) @f]
	*
	* To achieve machine accuracy in double precision floating point arithmetic
	* for most of the upper half of the complex plane , chose @f$t_m =12 @f$ and
	* @f$N =23 @f$ as is done in the paper .
	*
	* There are two complications : For Im(z) negative , the exponent in the
	* equation above becomes so large that the roundoff in the rest of the
	* calculation is amplified enough that the result cannot be trusted. 
	* Therefore, for Im (z) < 0, the symmetry of the erfc function under the
	* transformation z --> -z is used to avoid accuracy issues for Im(z) < 0 by
	* formulating the problem such that the calculation can be done for Im (z) > 0
	* where the accuracy of the method is fine , and some postprocessing then
	* yields the desired final result .
	*
	* Second , the denominators in the equation above become singular at
	* @f$z = n * pi / 12 @f$ ( for 0 <= n < 24) . In a tiny disc around these
	* points , Taylor expansions are used to overcome that difficulty .
	*
	* This routine precomputes everything it can , and tries to write out complex
	* operations to minimise subroutine calls , e.g. for the multiplication of
	* complex numbers .
	*
	* In the square -8 <= Re(z) <= 8, -8 <= Im(z) <= 8, the routine is accurate
	* to better than 4e -13 relative , the average relative error is better than
	* 7e -16. On a modern x86_64 machine , the routine is roughly three times as
	* fast than the old CERNLIB implementation and offers better accuracy .

	* Calculate the value of the Faddeeva function @f$w (z) = \ exp (-z ^2)
	* \ mathrm { erfc }( -i z) @f$ .
	*
	* This is the " fast " version of the faddeeva routine above . Fast means that
	* is takes roughly half the amount of CPU of the slow version of the
	* routine , but is a little less accurate .
	*
	* To be fast , chose @f$t_m =8 @f$ and @f$N =11 @f$ which should give accuracies
	* around 1e -7.
	*
	* In the square -8 <= Re(z) <= 8, -8 <= Im(z) <= 8, the routine is accurate
	* to better than 4e -7 relative , the average relative error is better than
	* 5e -9. On a modern x86_64 machine , the routine is roughly five times as
	* fast than the old CERNLIB implementation , or about 30% faster than the
	* interpolation / lookup table based fast method used previously in RooFit ,
	* and offers better accuracy than the latter ( the relative error is roughly
	* a factor 280 smaller than the old interpolation / table lookup routine ).
